In Indonesia, eye disorders rank among the top health concerns affecting dogs, with a considerable percentage resulting in vision impairment or blindness if not appropriately addressed. The 2023 Intage Group U&A Survey on Dog and Cat Owners highlighted that dogs are increasingly popular pets in Indonesia, with an ownership rate of 7.4% in households. This growing popularity reflects a heightened awareness of pet health, although eye health issues in dogs remain prevalent. Factors such as congenital problems, infections, degeneration, parasites, and inadequate nutrition can lead to these disorders.  Ophthalmic examinations play a critical role in the early detection of systemic disorders, particularly those impacting the vascular and nervous systems. To tackle these challenges, we have developed an app that leverages advanced technology to aid dog owners in monitoring and maintaining their pets' eye health. The app facilitates early detection of eye diseases through photo analysis and offers tailored care recommendations based on the specific conditions identified. Our goal is to bridge the existing gap in pet healthcare services and promote healthier, happier lives for dogs.
